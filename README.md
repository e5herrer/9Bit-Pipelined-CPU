9Bit-Pipelined-CPU
==================

A Pipelined 9-Bit CPU Simulation in System Verilog.
<p>
This was a project completed for CSE 141L Computer Architecture Project at UCSD
<br>Taught by Dean Tullsen in Fall 2013</p>

<ol>The project consisted of incrementally developing a CPU in stages:
<li>1. Design an ISA and Write 3 Programs (Pattern Counter, Multiplier, Occurrence Counter).</li>
<li>2. Design ALU, Program Counter, Register File.</li>
<li>3. Connect the modules of your design to construct a fully fledged single cycle Processor (optimize for cycle count).</li>
<li>4. Turn your CPU into a pipelined architecture.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Inside each stage of CPU development, there's a DOCS folder which details the ISA, CPU design specs,
and the programs written for it.</p>
